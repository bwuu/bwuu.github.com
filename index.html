<p>Hi, my name is Bryan Wu, and this a page where I'm recording the progress on some of my personal projects.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>Ray Tracer</h4>

<p>This is a basic raytracer that I'm writing in C++. Currently, it implements Phong lighting, reflections and transparency. I'm now working on implenting more types of primities (it currently only handles spheres and triangles) and antialiasing. Here are some images that it currently produces:</p>

<img src="/images/reflection.bmp" alt="reflection" width="700" height="700">

<img src="/images/bubbles.bmp" alt="bubbles!" width="700" height="700">

<img src="/images/colorbubbles.bmp" alt="bubbles!" width="700" height="700">
<p>Bubbles are so awesome.</p>

<p>Currently the raytracer only renders stills of hard-coded object, but I am working on getting an interactive executable up pretty soon to properly demo it.</p>

 <h4>Fluid Simulator</h4>

 <p> This is a fluid simulator that I'm also writing in C++. It uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Currently, it implements Weakly Compressible SPH and ghost particles at boundaries, as far as simulation quality goes. It uses marching cubes and OpenGL to produce visual output. This project was started a while ago (when I was just starting to program), so the source code is somewhat messy, as I haven't gotten around to fixing it yet. Anyways, here is some of its output right now:</p>

 <img src="/images/fluid1.bmp" width="250" height="250">
 <img src="/images/fluid2.png" width="250" height="250">
 <img src="/images/fluid3.png" width="250" height="250">
 <img src="/images/fluid4.png" width="250" height="250">
 <img src="/images/fluid5.png" width="250" height="250">

 <p>I will probably go back and rework this after the raytracer is done so that I can trace some scenes from this.</p>
